PROBLEM! std_lattice is bringing things to the stanrard CONVENTIONAL lattice, not the primitive one.
For this, we have the matrix (std_*).
However, the coordinates are in primitive vectors!
One needs to change, probably (going to primitive I think can be hardcoded)
TO UNDERSTAND! (e.g. also the volume change)


TODO implement aP case (niggli reduction in reciprocal space + reordering, see HKOT paper)

TODO provide as output also:
  - primitive cell (+ new atoms and types) CP
  - transformation matrix from user to CP (or viceversa: probably return the integer one and document what it is and how to get the opposite one) (+ determinant?)
  - used reciprocal lattice (in general, and especially for aP!]
  - ALSO: decide what to do if we want to use a supercell - maybe allow to 'force' the recognition of the bravais_lattice_case?
additional method:
  - [optionally?] absolute coords (in 2pi/original_units) of the k_path
    (this requires a 'density' of kpoints, take it from the KpointsData class?)

ASKED how to check correctness? -> probably calculate bands?



TODO add license
TODO Make tests for edge cases (or add the missing ones, some should be already there)
