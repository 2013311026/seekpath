TODO add license (first remove code copypasted from spglib?)
TODO Make tests for edge cases

TODO wait for spglib 1.9.3 to remove hardcoded spacegroups, and for Niggli reduction (also, in the test clases, use tuples instead of ASE)

TODO implement aP case (niggli reduction in reciprocal space + reordering, see HKOT paper)

TODO provide as output also:
  - primitive cell (+ new atoms and types)
  - transformation matrix
  - used reciprocal lattice (in general, and especially for aP!]
  - [optionally?] absolute coords (in 2pi/original_units) of the k_path
    (this requires a 'density' of kpoints, take it from the KpointsData class?)

ASKED how to check correctness? -> probably calculate bands?
