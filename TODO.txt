This is a list of TODOs

---------

- If possible, it would be nice to have the transformation matrix. 
  NOTE: this is being worked in the branch 'fix_transformation_matrix'.
   a. for non-aP lattices, this should be already possible. 
   Check if it is sufficient to combine the transf_matrix with the P matrix 
   b. for aP lattices, we should probably check if we can get the matrix out 
      of Niggli-reduce. This should be easy to obtain. Then,
  dd to the output:
    - the transformation matrix from user to standard, and from standard to 
      primitive (and the combination)
    - a warning/flag to say if the cell has changed in the process 
      (probably it will almost always change?)

-----------

- give option to show conventional cell
- Add more input file options
- in the visualiser: if two points overlap, decide if we can improve the visualisation (e.g. B2 = B' for mP1-noinv, see also discussion in sec. 4.4)
- currently, it is known that in touch devices the double-click enable/disable 
  option might be enabled-disabled in an unwanted way during pinch gestures, for instance
