TODO add license
TODO probably rename names in output dict of get_explicit_k_path? (e.g. something with prefix kpath_?)


- If possible, it would be nice to have the transformation matrix. 
   a. for non-aP cases, this should be already possible. Check if it is sufficient to combine the 
      transf_matrix with the P matrix 
   b. for aP cases, we should probably check if we can get the matrix out of Niggli-reduce (the order is
      not preserved... but the algorithm itself has internally the matrix, for what I can understand).
- Add to the output:
  - the transformation matrix from user to standard, and from standard to primitive (and the combination)
  - a warning/flag to say if the cell has changed in the process (probably it will almost always change?)
